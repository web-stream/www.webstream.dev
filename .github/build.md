## Building the project

The process of building the project is very simple all you need is this:

```bash
clone https://github.com/web-stream/www.webstream.dev.git
cd nodejs
npm install
make
```

While developing you can use -src versions they are work fine. Make will just create
Release files that have proper version number, create minified files and build emoji
css.
